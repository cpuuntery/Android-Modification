Maybe even better than dumpsys SurfaceFlinger

If the app is open, run the command
var=$(dumpsys window displays | grep reportedVisible=true -B 2 | grep {package})
if [[ ! -z $var ]]; then {The command}; fi

If the app is NOT open, run the command
var=$(dumpsys window displays | grep reportedVisible=true -B 2 | grep {package})
if [[ -z $var ]]; then {The command}; fi



If the app is open, run the command
var=$(dumpsys SurfaceFlinger | grep {package} | grep {Package size on the screen, this is very important})
if [[ ! -z $var ]]; then {The command}; fi

If the app is NOT open, run the command
var=$(dumpsys SurfaceFlinger | grep {package} | grep {Package size on the screen, this is very important})
if [[ -z $var ]]; then {The command}; fi





You can use meminfo instead of SurfaceFlinger but it is a bit slower
If the app is open, run the command
var=$(dumpsys meminfo | grep Foreground -A 1 | grep {package})
if [[ ! -z $var ]]; then {The command}; fi

If the app is NOT open, run the command
var=$(dumpsys meminfo | grep Foreground -A 1 | grep {package})
if [[ -z $var ]]; then {The command}; fi

P.S If you have an issue with {grep Foreground -A 1} you can use {grep :\ Foreground -A 1}
