This command allows you to list apps that has the appops READ_CLIPBOARD set to [allow]
and you can set the command to list the apps that are denied by changing allow to [ignore]
and I guess by not specifying allow or ignore it will list all apps that use the appops


adb shell cmd appops query-op --user 0 READ_CLIPBOARD allow

To set the appops for an app

adb shell cmd appops set <packagename> <appops> ignore or allow
