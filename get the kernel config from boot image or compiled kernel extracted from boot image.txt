wget https://github.com/torvalds/linux/raw/master/scripts/extract-ikconfig && chmod a+x extract-ikconfig

you can use extract-ikconfig with boot images with extracting the kernel from the boot image
but if that did not work, you can try to extract kernel using for example abootimg

sudo apt install android-tools-mkbootimg abootimg

abootimg -x boot.img

wget https://github.com/torvalds/linux/raw/master/scripts/extract-ikconfig && chmod a+x extract-ikconfig
./extract-ikconfig boot.img-zImage > extracted_defconfig to get defconfig from stock kernel.
and maybe
./extract-ikconfig boot.img-zImage > .config
.config  must be in the source diractory


or


wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/scripts/extract-ikconfig ;
chmod +x extract-ikconfig

./extract-ikconfig boot.img > xosp711_Z00L_defconfig

and as i understand it. 
this is needed when you try to compile the kernel from source
but when you compile a custom kernel from github it is not needed

Because the works is already done by the custom kernel developer
